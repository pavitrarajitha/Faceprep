Description

Professor Kishore wanted the kids to learn about Special numbers. (A two-digit number is said to be a special number if the sum of sum of its digits and the product of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 19 is a special number. The digits in 19 are 1 and 9. The sum of the digits is 10 and the product of the digits is 9. 10+9 = 19.)

Can you help Kishore to write a program to find all special numbers between 2 limits m and n (both inclusive)? Assume that m and n are two-digit numbers.

PROGRAM
m=int(input())
n=int(input())
for num in range(m,n+1):
  m1=num // 10
  m2=num % 10
  n1=m1+m2
  n2=m1*m2
  if n1+n2==num:
    print(num)
