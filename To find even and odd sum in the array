Dolores Abarnathy and Maeve Millay were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.
Input Format:
Input consists of n+1 integers. 
The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 
The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 
Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.
Output Format:
Refer to sample output for details.
Sample Input:
5
2
3
6
8
-1
Sample Output:
The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2
Case 1
Case 2
Case 3
Input (stdin)
5
2
3
6
8
-1
Output (stdout)
The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2

program
n=int(input())
m=[int(input()) for i in range(n)]
sum1=0
sum2=0
for i in m:
   if i%2==0:
       sum1+=i
   else:
       sum2+=i
print("The sum of the even numbers in the array is",sum1)
print("The sum of the odd numbers in the array is"sum2)
